<h4>In 1936, the world was stressed. Another world war, Turkey had just remilitarized the Bosphorus Strait, and Germany likewise remilitarized the Rhineland, breaching the Treaty of Versailles from the First World War.  Adolf Hitler delivered ultra-nationalist rants against everyone; he also rebuilt industry, manpower, the navy, aviation, and even restored faith in the Germans.</h4>

<h4>  Italy invaded Ethiopia and subjugated Albania in order to demonstrate to the Italian people that they, too, deserved to dominate the entire world.</h4>
    
    
<h4> The Japanese Empire, which declared war on partitioned China, also sought to control the world; these are the three key powers in the Axis. The axis also included Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, although they didn't do much.</h4>
    
    
    
    
<h4> Hitler abused the allies---who were attempting to establish world peace--- by annexing Austria, Memel, and Sudentland, but on September 1, 1939, Hitler invaded Poland, and the Second World War formally began. Germany conquering Denmark, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France in June 1940. </h4>
    
<h4> The Soviets invaded the Baltics, Tannu Tuva, and declared war on Finland, but failed horribly. After the Soviets made peace with them, Finland begged Germany that if they launched war on the Soviets, they would unconditionally back them.</h4>
    
    
<h4>  Back to Japan, they were dominating in Asia; China, Indochina, the Philippines, Southeast Asia—and all the islands in between—were controlled by Japan, but their reign came to an end when they attacked Pearl Harbor, USA.</h4>
<h4> On June 22, 1941, Adolf Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa. It marked the start of a campaign that would ultimately decide the Second World War. At first, the Germans enjoyed remarkable success, but winter arrived, and Joseph Stalin has called the Siberian Army. With the USSR from the east and Operation D-Day from the west, Germany was unable to stand and fell, Italy switched sides and deposed Mussolini, but in Japan, the US couldn't invade mainland Japan because it would cost time, manpower, and money, so they used their new weapon (nuclear bombs) to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Following it, emperor Hirohito soon announced that the empire of Japan surrendered, signaling the end of the war.</h4>
    
    
    
<h4>  By the end of World War II, much of Europe, Asia, and Africa had been devastated. Combat and bombardment had leveled cities and towns, devastated bridges and railroads, and burnt the countryside. The war had also claimed a startling number of military and civilian fatalities of 70 million.</h4>
    
    
<h4> Food, fuel, and other consumer product shortages persisted and, in many cases, deteriorated following the declaration of peace. War-torn Europe and Japan were unable to create enough goods for their own populations, let alone for export.</h4>
    
<h4> In addition to the human cost and suffering, governments spent more money on World War II than on all previous conflicts combined. By 1945, depleted countries had significant economic issues, which hampered restoration attempts.
